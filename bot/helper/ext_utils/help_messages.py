Example: Title https://www.rss-url.com inf: 1080 or 720 or 144p|mkv or mp4|hevc exf: flv or web|xxx
This filter will parse links that it's titles contains `(1080 or 720 or 144p) and (mkv or mp4) and hevc` and doesn't conyain (flv or web) and xxx` words. You can add whatever you want.

Another example: inf:  1080  or 720p|.web. or .webrip.|hvec or x264. This will parse titles that contains ( 1080  or 720p) and (.web. or .webrip.) and (hvec or x264). I have added space before and after 1080 to avoid wrong matching. If this `10805695` number in title it will match 1080 if added 1080 without spaces after it.

Filter Notes:
1. | means and.
2. Add `or` between similar keys, you can add it between qualities or between extensions, so don't add filter like this f: 1080|mp4 or 720|web because this will parse 1080 and (mp4 or 720) and web ... not (1080 and mp4) or (720 and web)."
3. You can add `or` and `|` as much as you want."
4. Take look on title if it has static special character after or before the qualities or extensions or whatever and use them in filter to avoid wrong match.
