Note: Add `^` before integer or float, some values must be numeric and some string.
Like playlist_items:10 works with string, so no need to add `^` before the number but playlistend works only with integer so you must add `^` before the number like example above.
You can add tuple and dict also. Use double quotes inside dict.

You can directly add the upload path: -up remote:dir/subdir or -up (Gdrive_id) or -up id/username
If DEFAULT_UPLOAD is `rc` then you can pass up: `gd` to upload using gdrive tools to GDRIVE_ID.
If DEFAULT_UPLOAD is `gd` then you can pass up: `rc` to upload to RCLONE_PATH.
If you want to add path or gdrive manually from your config/token (uploaded from usetting) add <code>mrcc:</code> for rclone and <code>mtp:</code> before the path/gdrive_id without space
<code>/cmd</code> link -up <code>mrcc:</code>main:dump or -up <code>mtp:</code>gdrive_id or -up b:id/username(leech by bot) or -up u:id/username(leech by user)

link3 -e -n new name -opt ytdlpoptions
Note: You can't add -m arg for some links only, do it for all links or use multi without bulk!

Reply to this example by this cmd <code>/cmd</code> b(bulk)
You can set start and end of the links from the bulk with -b start:end or only end by -b :end or only start by -b start. The default start is from zero(first link) to inf.

<b>TG Links</b>:
Treat links like any direct link
Some links need user access so sure you must add USER_SESSION_STRING for it.
Three types of links:
Public: <code>https://t.me/channel_name/message_id</code>
Private: <code>tg://openmessage?user_id=xxxxxx&message_id=xxxxx</code>
Super: <code>https://t.me/c/channel_id/message_id</code>

RSS_HELP_MESSAGE = """
Use this format to add feed url:
Title1 link (required)
Title2 link -c cmd -inf xx -exf xx
Title3 link -c cmd -d ratio:time -z password

-c command -up mrcc:remote:path/subdir -rcf --buffer-size:8M|key|key:value
-inf For included words filter.
-exf For excluded words filter.

Example: Title https://www.rss-url.com inf: 1080 or 720 or 144p|mkv or mp4|hevc exf: flv or web|xxx
This filter will parse links that it's titles contains `(1080 or 720 or 144p) and (mkv or mp4) and hevc` and doesn't conyain (flv or web) and xxx` words. You can add whatever you want.

Another example: inf:  1080  or 720p|.web. or .webrip.|hvec or x264. This will parse titles that contains ( 1080  or 720p) and (.web. or .webrip.) and (hvec or x264). I have added space before and after 1080 to avoid wrong matching. If this `10805695` number in title it will match 1080 if added 1080 without spaces after it.

Filter Notes:
1. | means and.
2. Add `or` between similar keys, you can add it between qualities or between extensions, so don't add filter like this f: 1080|mp4 or 720|web because this will parse 1080 and (mp4 or 720) and web ... not (1080 and mp4) or (720 and web)."
3. You can add `or` and `|` as much as you want."
4. Take look on title if it has static special character after or before the qualities or extensions or whatever and use them in filter to avoid wrong match.
