------

### 3. Getting Google OAuth API credential file and token.pickle

**NOTES**
- Old authentication changed, now we can't use bot or replit to generate token.pickle. You need OS with a browser.
- Windows users should install python3 and pip. You can find how to install and use them from google or from this [telegraph](https://telegra.ph/Create-Telegram-Mirror-Leech-Bot-by-Deploying-App-with-Heroku-Branch-using-Github-Workflow-12-06) from [Wiszky](https://github.com/vishnoe115) tutorial.
- You can ONLY open the generated link from `generate_drive_token.py` in local browser.

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
3. Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
4. Choose Desktop and Create.
5. Publish your OAuth consent screen App to prevent **token.pickle** from expire
6. Use the download button to download your credentials.
7. Move that file to the root of mirrorbot, and rename it to **credentials.json**
8. Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
9. Search for Google Drive Api and enable it
10. Finally, run the script to generate **token.pickle** file for Google Drive:
```
pip3 install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```
------

## Deploying on VPS

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
1. You must set `SERVER_PORT` variable to `80` or any other port you want to use.
2. To clear the container (this will not affect on the image):
```
sudo docker container prune
```
3. To delete the images:
```
sudo docker image prune -a
```
4. Check the number of processing units of your machine with `nproc` cmd and times it by 4, then edit `AsyncIOThreadsCount` in qBittorrent.conf.
5. You can add `CONFIG_FILE_URL` variable using docker and docker-compose, google it.

------

### Deploying on VPS Using Docker

- Start Docker daemon (SKIP if already running):
```
sudo dockerd
```
- Build Docker image:
```
sudo docker build . -t mirror-bot
```
- Run the image:
```
sudo docker run -p 80:80 mirror-bot
```
- To stop the image:
```
sudo docker ps
```
```
sudo docker stop id
```

----

### Deploying on VPS Using docker-compose

**NOTE**: If you want to use port other than 80, change it in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/anasty17/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) also.

```
sudo apt install docker-compose
```
- Build and run Docker image:
```
sudo docker-compose up
```
- After editing files with nano for example (nano start.sh):
```
sudo docker-compose up --build
```
- To stop the image:
```
sudo docker-compose stop
```
- To run the image:
```
sudo docker-compose start
```

------

## UPSTREAM REPO (Recommended)

- `UPSTREAM_REPO` variable can be used for edit/add any file in repository.
- You can add private/public repository link to grab/overwrite all files from it.
- You can skip adding the privates files like token.pickle or accounts folder before deploying, also no need to add variables direct links except **config.env**, simply fill `UPSTREAM_REPO` private one in case you want to grab all files including private files.
- If you added private files while deploying and you have added private `UPSTREAM_REPO` and your private files in this private repository, so your private files will be overwritten from this repository. Also if you are using URL variables like `TOKEN_PICKLE_URL` then all files from those variables will override the private files that added before deploying or from private `UPSTREAM_REPO`.
- If you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with the official repository link, then be carefull incase any change in requirements.txt your bot will not start after restart. In this case you need to deploy again with updated code to install the new requirements or simply by changing the `UPSTREAM_REPO` to you fork link with that old updates.
- In case you you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with your fork link be carefull also if you fetched the commits from the official repository.
- The changes in your `UPSTREAM_REPO` will take affect only after restart.
- `UPSTREAM_BRANCH` don't ever fill heroku here.

------

## Bittorrent Seed

- Add `d:ratio:time` perfix along with leech or mirror cmd.
- Using `d` perfix alone will lead to use global options for aria2c or qbittorrent.

### Qbittorrent
- Global options: `MaxRatio` and `GlobalMaxSeedingMinutes` in qbittorrent.conf, `-1` means no limit, but you can cancel manually.
  - **NOTE**: Don't change `MaxRatioAction`.

### Aria2c
- Global options: `--seed-ratio` (0 means no limit) and `--seed-time` (0 means no seed) in aria.sh.

------

## Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit

>For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = "True" in config file or environment variables.
>**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

### 1. Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account?](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need.

**Warning**: Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google.

>**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
>**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can upload/copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can upload 75 TB a day or clone 2 TB from each file creator (uploader email).

#### Two methods to create service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)
- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

##### 2. Create Service Accounts in New Project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

### 2. Add Service Accounts

#### Two methods to add service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Add Them To Google Group then to Team Drive (Recommended)
- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
- `For Windows using PowerShell`
```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>emails.txt
```
- `For Linux`
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd ..
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add this Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager and delete email.txt file from accounts folder

##### 2. Add Them To Team Drive Directly
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

------

### Generate Database

1. Go to `https://mongodb.com/` and sign-up.
2. Create Shared Cluster.
3. Press on `Database` under `Deployment` Header, your created cluster will be there.
5. Press on connect, choose `Allow Acces From Anywhere` and press on `Add IP Address` without editing the ip, then create user.
6. After creating user press on `Choose a connection`, then press on `Connect your application`. Choose `Driver` **python** and `version` **3.6 or later**.
7. Copy your `connection string` and replace `<password>` with the password of your user, then press close.

------

## Multi Drive List
To use list from multi TD/folder. Run driveid.py in your terminal and follow it. It will generate **list_drives.txt** file or u can simply create `list_drives.txt` file in working directory and fill it, check below format:
```
DriveName folderID/tdID or `root` IndexLink(if available)
DriveName folderID/tdID or `root` IndexLink(if available)
```

Example:
```
TD1 root https://example.dev
TD2 0AO1JDB1t3i5jUk9PVA https://example.dev
```
-----

## Yt-dlp and Aria2c Authentication Using .netrc File
For using your premium accounts in yt-dlp or for protected Index Links, create .netrc file according to following format:

**Note**: Create .netrc and not netrc, this file will be hidden, so view hidden files to edit it after creation.

Format:
```
machine host login username password my_password
```
Example:
```
machine instagram login anas.tayyar password mypassword
```
**Instagram Note**: You must login even if you want to download public posts and after first try you must confirm that this was you logged in from different ip(you can confirm from phone app).

**Youtube Note**: For `youtube` authentication use [cookies.txt](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl) file.

Using Aria2c you can also use built in feature from bot with or without username. Here example for index link without username.
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. instagram, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.
